 *    hardened or read-only-deploy hosts, and a logger that warns or fatals on a
 *    visitor-facing request is worse than one that records nothing.
 *  - The file name is unguessable and never disclosed. `.htaccess` does nothing
 *    on nginx, so the name is the real protection; the download handler derives
 *    the path itself and takes no filename parameter.
 *  - Over the size cap the log stops accepting writes rather than trimming or
 *    rotating. Someone reproducing a bug must not have the tail of their repro
 *    evicted by newer noise from an unrelated visitor.
